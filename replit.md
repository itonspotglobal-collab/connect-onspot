# OnSpot

## Overview
OnSpot is an outsourcing management system that integrates BPO services and freelancing with an Apple-inspired design. It aims to simplify outsourcing for B2B and B2C clients using AI for talent matching, performance management, and project coordination. The platform offers a comprehensive solution for managing talent, projects, and client relationships with real-time tracking and automated workflows, built with React, TypeScript, Express, and PostgreSQL.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui components on Radix UI, styled with Tailwind CSS, following Apple Human Interface Guidelines.
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state.

- **Immersive Routes**: Full-screen experiences for campaigns and service pages without navigation.
- **Design System**: Apple-inspired interface with light/dark mode, consistent spacing, and SF Pro Display fonts.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **API Design**: RESTful API structure.
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM.
- **Storage Pattern**: Repository pattern via `IStorage` interface.

  - **Streaming Responses**: Real-time streaming via `/api/chat/stream` endpoint with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
  - **Thread Persistence**: OpenAI-managed thread persistence for natural conversation continuity across sessions
  - **Knowledge Base System**: Structured text-based knowledge file at `/resources/vanessa_knowledge.txt` containing:
    - Company information (mission, headquarters, contact details)
    - Job Success System (JSS) framework
    - Talent Acquisition Framework
    - Core values and hiring principles
    - Services, pricing, and FAQs
    - Vanessa's persona guidelines
  - **Knowledge Upload**: Automated script at `/scripts/uploadVanessaKnowledgeTxt.ts` creates vector store and attaches to Assistant
    - Run: `npx tsx scripts/uploadVanessaKnowledgeTxt.ts`
    - Creates vector store with File Search enabled
    - Automatically links to Assistant via OpenAI API
  - **Two-Tier Memory System**: Vanessa uses both short-term and long-term memory to learn from user corrections
    - **Short-Term Conversational Memory** (Instant Recall):
      - Detects correction patterns in real-time ("you should", "actually", "the correct answer is", "remember that")
      - Stores corrections instantly in Replit DB with key format `memory:<topic>`
      - Acknowledges corrections: "Understood, I've updated my memory with that information."
      - Injects all stored memories into every chat context for immediate recall
      - Memories appear in chat instructions under `[Remembered Corrections]` section
      - Console log: `üß† Memory saved for topic: {topic}` and `üí° Injected {N} memory correction(s) into context`
    - **Long-Term Knowledge Consolidation**:
      - Learning loop automatically consolidates memories into `/resources/vanessa_knowledge.txt`
      - Groups memories by topic and writes as sections: `=== {topic} (Memory Update YYYY-MM-DD) ===`
      - Clears short-term memories after successful consolidation to prevent duplication
      - Runs as part of auto-triggered learning loop (2+ similar feedbacks)
      - Console logs: `üß† Consolidating {N} memory correction(s)...` and `‚úÖ Memory consolidation completed!`
    - **Forget Command**: Users can clear specific memories with "forget {topic}"
      - Strips command verbs (forget/remove/delete/clear) to extract target topic
      - Responds: "I've forgotten everything about {topic}."
      - Console log: `üóëÔ∏è Memory deleted for topic: {topic}`
    - **Implementation**:
      - `server/services/db_manager.ts`: Memory storage functions (storeMemory, getAllMemories, deleteMemory, clearAllMemories)
      - `server/services/openaiService.ts`: Correction detection, memory injection, forget command
      - `server/services/learningLoop.ts`: consolidateMemories() function
  - **Self-Learning System**: AI continuously improves through user feedback and automated analysis
    - **User Feedback**: Thumbs up/down buttons with optional comments on every AI response
    - **Conversation Storage**: All chats and feedbacks stored in PostgreSQL `vanessa_logs` and `feedbacks` tables
    - **Feedback Tracking**: 
      - Feedbacks stored in PostgreSQL `feedbacks` table with thread_id, message_id, rating, comment, topic, timestamps
      - Topic extraction identifies keywords from user messages/comments using stopword filtering
      - Feedback grouped by topic for similarity detection
      - Auto-count feedbacks by topic using PostgreSQL queries
    - **Auto-Trigger Learning**: System automatically runs learning loop when 2+ similar feedbacks detected
      - Extracts topics from feedback comments (e.g., "CEO", "Delivery", "Pricing")
      - Tracks feedback count per topic
      - Triggers learning automatically when threshold met (2 similar feedbacks)
      - Runs in background without blocking response
      - Enhanced console logging for all events
    - **Knowledge Ingestion**: Admin can trigger AI-powered summarization of files in `/resources/knowledge/`
    - **Learning Loop**: Admin can trigger AI analysis of feedback patterns to generate actionable insights (also auto-triggered)
    - **Auto-Update Knowledge Base**: Vanessa automatically updates `/resources/vanessa_knowledge.txt` after each successful learning loop
      - Uses OpenAI to extract 1-3 main topics from learning insights
      - Finds and replaces existing sections OR appends new ones
      - Section format: `=== Topic (Learned YYYY-MM-DD) ===`
      - Security: Text sanitization, 1MB file size limit
      - Map-based topic-section pairing prevents duplicate/missing updates
