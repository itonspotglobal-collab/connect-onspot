I need you to fix my Lead Intake form submission and connect it to my PostgreSQL database table named `lead_intakes`.

Here’s the situation:

- My frontend file is `LeadIntake.tsx`, and it sends a POST request to `/api/lead-intake`.
- The database table `lead_intakes` already exists and has the following fields:

id (UUID, primary key, default gen_random_uuid()),
first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, job_title, company_name,
company_size, industry, company_website, service_type, current_challenges,
service_volume, required_skills (TEXT[]), urgency_level, budget_range,
expected_start_date, team_size, has_current_provider, current_provider_details,
decision_maker_status, implementation_timeline, additional_notes,
source (default 'website'), status (default 'new'), created_at (default now())

The problem is that when I submit the form, I get this error:
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "message": "Invalid body data provided",
  "details": [...]
}

That means the backend route `/api/lead-intake.ts` doesn’t exist or isn’t saving data correctly.

I need you to:

1. **Create a new API route file** `/app/api/lead-intake/route.ts` (for Next.js 13+ app router)
   - It should handle POST requests.
   - Validate required fields.
   - Insert all submitted fields into the `lead_intakes` table.
   - Return a success response with the new record’s ID.
   - Use `@vercel/postgres` (or pg) for DB connection.

2. **Make sure the payload matches** the database field names (use snake_case).

3. **After successful insert**, optionally call the GoHighLevel API to create a contact using:
   `https://api.msgsndr.com/api/v2/contacts/`
   Include fields like first name, last name, email, phone, and company.
   Use an environment variable `GHL_API_KEY` for authorization.

4. Test the endpoint by submitting the form and confirm that data appears in the `lead_intakes` table.
   You can verify by running:
   `SELECT * FROM lead_intakes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;`

In summary:
- The route should insert form data into `lead_intakes`.
- It should return a JSON success response.
- Optionally, it should trigger a GoHighLevel API request after saving.
- Fix any schema or naming mismatch causing the “Invalid body data” error.

Please generate the full, working `/app/api/lead-intake/route.ts` code that does this.
