Vibe Coding Description: “Launch AI Assistant — Vanessa”
 
1. Trigger Animation
 
When users click “Launch AI Assistant”, the button glows softly and expands the screen into a semi-transparent chat overlay.
Use smooth transitions (fade-in or upward slide) with light blur — it should feel like a futuristic system coming online.
 
 
2. Vanessa Interface Design
 
Layout:
Chat window fixed on the right or center of the screen (like Intercom or ChatGPT mini window).
Rounded corners, soft shadow, minimalist interface.
Background: semi-transparent gradient (deep violet → navy blue).
Message bubbles: clean white for Vanessa, soft gray/blue for the user.
Subtle typing animation (three-dot pulse).
 
Avatar:
Realistic human portrait of Vanessa.

Apple x OpenAI x Human Touch.

Mid-30s woman, friendly and intelligent aura.
Professional but warm — mixed ethnicity look (Filipina-European vibe).
