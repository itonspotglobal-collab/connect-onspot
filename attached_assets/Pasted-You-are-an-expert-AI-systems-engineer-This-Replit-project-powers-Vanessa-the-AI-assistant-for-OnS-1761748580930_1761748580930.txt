You are an expert AI systems engineer.

This Replit project powers Vanessa, the AI assistant for OnSpot Workspace.

Extend Vanessa’s abilities so she can **crawl and understand the OnSpotGlobal.com website**, while **excluding private/admin areas** like `vanessa-responses`, `admin`, `dashboard`, or anything behind login pages.

---

### 🎯 Objectives

1. **Website Crawler Setup**
   - Create a crawler module `server/services/siteCrawler.ts`
   - Crawl the website starting from:
     ```
     https://onspotglobal.com/
     ```
   - Follow **only internal links** within the same domain.
   - Use libraries such as `axios`, `cheerio`, or `node-fetch`.

2. **Crawl Filtering Rules**
   - ✅ Include only URLs that:
     - Start with `https://onspotglobal.com/`
   - 🚫 Exclude URLs that contain any of the following:
     - `/vanessa-responses`
     - `/admin`
     - `/dashboard`
     - `/login`
     - `/api/`
     - Query strings (`?`, `#`)
   - Example of included/excluded behavior:
     | URL | Crawl? |
     |------|--------|
     | https://onspotglobal.com/about | ✅ Yes |
     | https://onspotglobal.com/services | ✅ Yes |
     | https://onspotglobal.com/vanessa-responses | ❌ No |
     | https://onspotglobal.com/admin/settings | ❌ No |
     | https://onspotglobal.com/contact#form | ❌ No |

3. **Extract and Store Site Data**
   - From each crawled page, extract:
     - Page URL
     - `<title>` tag
     - Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)
     - Visible paragraph text (trimmed)
   - Summarize the content using OpenAI (GPT-4) for clean descriptions:
     ```json
     {
       "url": "https://onspotglobal.com/about",
       "title": "About OnSpot",
       "summary": "OnSpot Global provides workspace and outsourcing solutions to businesses around the world."
     }
     ```
   - Save results to `/resources/site_index.json`

4. **Automatic Updating**
   - Re-crawl once every 24 hours via a scheduled job (use `node-cron`).
   - Replace or update existing entries.
   - Log in console:
     ```
     🌐 Site crawl completed at 2025-10-30T03:00Z — 18 pages indexed
     ```

5. **Navigation & Context Awareness**
   - When a user mentions navigation or site pages:
     - Search the local site index (`site_index.json`) for matches.
     - Reply with the correct URL and summary.
   - Examples:
     ```
     User: Take me to the pricing page.
     Vanessa: You can find our pricing details here:
     🔗 https://onspotglobal.com/pricing
     On this page, you’ll see our workspace package options and rates.
     ```

6. **Admin Controls**
   - Add `/api/site/reindex` endpoint:
     - Admin-only.
     - Triggers manual re-crawling.
     - Logs:
       ```
       🔁 Admin triggered manual site reindex.
       ```

7. **Security & Efficiency**
   - Respect `robots.txt` (if present).
   - Limit concurrent requests (1 per second max).
   - Do not crawl images, PDFs, or other binary assets.
   - Cap crawl depth to 3 levels.
   - Max total pages: 200.

### ⚙️ Validation

1. Run `/api/site/reindex` (admin only).
2. Confirm the console output:
🌐 Crawling OnSpotGlobal.com ...
✅ Indexed 15 public pages.

markdown
Copy code
3. Check `/resources/site_index.json` — should list all public pages (no admin or response pages).
4. Ask Vanessa:
- “Take me to the contact page.”
- “Show me the careers section.”
- “What does OnSpot Global do?”
5. Vanessa should respond with links and page summaries.
