I want to integrate OpenAI’s Assistant API into my site to power our chatbot "Vanessa".

We already have:
- OPENAI_API_KEY stored in Replit Secrets
- ASSISTANT_ID stored in Replit Secrets
- Frontend chat UI in VanessaChat.tsx that calls /api/chat/stream

Please do the following:

1. Create a new file `lib/openaiService.ts` with the following logic:
   - Import OpenAI from "openai"
   - Initialize the client with `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Include two functions:
     a. `sendMessageToAssistant(message: string, threadId?: string)` → sends the user message to the Assistant and returns the full response.
     b. `streamMessageToAssistant(message: string, threadId?: string)` → streams the Assistant response using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
   - Both functions must use the Assistant stored in `process.env.ASSISTANT_ID`.

   Use the OpenAI code pattern:
   ```ts
   import OpenAI from "openai";
   const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

   const response = await client.responses.create({
     model: "gpt-5",
     input: message,
     stream: true
   });
but replace it with the correct assistant API (client.beta.threads.run or equivalent).

Create a new file pages/api/chat/stream.ts that:

Imports streamMessageToAssistant from lib/openaiService.ts.

Accepts POST requests with { message, threadId }.

Streams JSON data events back to the browser (type: content | threadId | done | error).

Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live typing responses.

Update any existing /api/chat routes to use these new helper functions if they don’t already.

Confirm that VanessaChat.tsx calls /api/chat/stream (it already does).
This ensures the frontend sends user messages and displays Vanessa’s responses in real time.

Finally:

Run npm install openai

Verify that everything compiles and the chatbot is responding.

If OpenAI responds correctly, it should now use my real Assistant “VanessaAI” (based on the ASSISTANT_ID secret).

This integration must follow the OpenAI SDK pattern shown in their Developer Quickstart.
