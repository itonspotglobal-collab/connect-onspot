Update TopNavigation.tsx so that clicking the “Access Portal” button opens a multi-step modal flow, replacing the previous Login/SignUp buttons.

Requirements:

Step 1 – Intro Screen:

Show only:

Text: "The first Superhuman BPO is coming soon."

A centered button labeled Continue.

Style it like the current login modal: centered, rounded, with background blur and shadow.

Step 2 – Portal Selection:

After clicking Continue, transition (fade/slide) into a new modal state that displays:

The OnSpot logo at the top.

Heading: "Welcome to OnSpot"

Subtext: "Choose your portal to continue."

Two portal cards (Client and Talent), matching the design from your existing login modal:

Client Portal

Blue icon (building)

Description: “Access your hiring dashboard, manage projects, and track performance.”

Feature icons: “70% Cost Savings”, “8X Growth”, “24/7 Support”

Talent Portal

Yellow icon (user)

Description: “Access opportunities, manage your profile, and track your career growth.”

Feature icons: “Premium Jobs”, “Secure Payments”, “Career Growth”

A small “Admin Portal” button below, styled subtly (gray outline).

Step 3 – Authentication Flow:

When the user selects a portal (Client or Talent), show the existing Login/SignUp step.

Reuse the current LoginDialog and SignUpDialog components for this (do not re-create logic).

The modal content should smoothly transition between steps.

Animations & UX:

Use data-[state=open] and data-[state=closed] transitions from your current modal styles.

Smooth fade-in/out or slide-up transitions between steps.

Ensure the modal is responsive and centered.

Implementation Details:

Use useState to manage modal step: step = 1 | 2 | 3.

Add a close button in the top-right corner.

Make sure Esc and outside clicks close the modal.

Ensure consistent styling with Tailwind + ShadCN UI.

Reuse Dialog, DialogContent, and Button components from your existing UI system.

Bonus:

Optional: Add a subtle fade overlay behind the modal (semi-transparent dark layer).

📁 Files to update:

TopNavigation.tsx → Replace Login/SignUp buttons with a single Access Portal button and modal logic.

(Optional) Create a new component AccessPortalModal.tsx if separation is preferred.
