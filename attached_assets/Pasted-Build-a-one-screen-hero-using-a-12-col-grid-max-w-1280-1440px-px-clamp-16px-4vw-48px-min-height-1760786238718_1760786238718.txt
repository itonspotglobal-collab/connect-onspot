Build a one-screen hero using a 12-col grid (max-w:1280–1440px; px: clamp(16px,4vw,48px); min-height:100svh). Left side (cols 1–6): stack COMING SOON… (plain text, no pill), H1 “The next evolution of outsourcing.”, subline “Powered by intelligence and human brilliance.”, then the two homepage CTAs (keep subtle shadows only; no boxes behind text). Right side (cols 7–12): place the brain asset (the attached gradient brain) inside a fixed container position:relative; overflow:visible; and an absolutely centered child for the image position:absolute; right:0; top:50%; transform:translateY(-50%); width: clamp(420px, 44vw, 800px); so it slightly overlaps/touches the H1 (allow overflow:visible on the grid and a tiny negative margin-left on the brain like -2% to kiss the title). Animate the brain with transform scale only so layout never shifts: @keyframes brainPulse { 0%{transform:translateY(-50%) scale(0.96); opacity:.9} 50%{transform:translateY(-50%) scale(1.06); opacity:.55} 100%{transform:translateY(-50%) scale(0.96); opacity:.9}} apply animation: brainPulse 6s ease-in-out infinite; will-change: transform, opacity; Add a very soft rotating hue sweep overlay (optional) for subtle life: a pseudo-element with radial gradient mix-blend: screen; opacity:.15; animation: 18s linear infinite rotate. Keep headline legibility via a text halo only: text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #fff, 0 0 24px rgba(140,120,255,.25); (do not blur the brain). Spacing & alignment: limit text line length to 68ch, H1 font-size: clamp(40px, 7vw, 96px); line-height:1.05; letter-spacing:-0.01em;, sub clamp(16px,2.2vw,22px); opacity:.8;, vertical gaps gap: clamp(12px,2.8vh,28px). Responsiveness: at ≤1024px collapse to single column; keep brain behind text (centered, width: clamp(420px, 84vw, 820px); opacity:.5;) and reduce overlap to avoid crowding; at ≤640px stack CTAs full-width and lower H1 to clamp(34px, 9vw, 44px). Brand header: remove full nav; show OnSpot logo only (top-center, small glow), no card/box behind it. Accessibility & performance: prefers-reduced-motion → freeze the brain at scale(1.0); opacity:.7 (no animation); ensure contrast AA; use requestAnimationFrame/CSS only (no heavy libs). Acceptance: brain reads instantly (dense, clear), smooth pulse that grows/softens then returns, headline untouched by blur, hero perfectly aligned with no layout shift across all screens.
