Update the talent portal: src/pages/TalentPortal.tsx (the TalentPortal component).

GOAL
- Make the "Start Earning in 3 Simple Steps" section appear IMMEDIATELY UNDER the hero (the first section).
- Keep the visual design of the step cards unchanged.
- Move ClientLogos and StatisticsBar to appear AFTER the steps (as in the mock).
- Do not change the hero content or styles, only the order and spacing.
- Ensure there is no duplicate steps section left behind.

CHANGES

1) CUT the entire "How It Works Section" block. In the current file it begins with:
   <section className="py-20 bg-background">
   and ends at its closing </section> (the block with the heading “Start Earning in 3 Simple Steps” and the 3 cards).

2) PASTE that whole block **right after** the first hero section. Concretely:
   - Find the closing tag of the hero section:
     </section>  // (the one with class "relative min-h-screen ...")
   - Immediately after that closing tag, insert the "How It Works Section" you cut in step 1.

3) Update the outer wrapper classes on the moved steps section to tighten the spacing to the hero:
   - Change <section className="py-20 bg-background"> to:
     <section className="py-14 md:py-20 bg-background">

4) REORDER the sections that follow:
   - After the moved steps section, keep the ClientLogos section, then the StatisticsBar section (in that order).
   - Make sure the original ClientLogos and StatisticsBar blocks remain intact, just positioned AFTER the steps section.
   - Remove any leftover copy of the old steps section so there’s only ONE instance on the page.

5) Keep all JSX and styles INSIDE the steps section exactly the same (the 3 cards, numbers, icons, chevrons, CTA “Join OnSpot Today”, etc.). Don’t change card content or styles—only placement and outer spacing.

6) Sanity checks / acceptance criteria:
   - The page should render the hero first.
   - Immediately below the hero, the “Start Earning in 3 Simple Steps” heading and its 3 cards should be visible.
   - Below that, show client logos, then the statistics bar.
   - There must be no second/duplicate steps section elsewhere on the page.
   - On mobile the cards stack; on desktop they remain in three columns as before.

Make only the described reordering and tiny spacing change. Don’t modify any other content, imports, hooks, or components.
