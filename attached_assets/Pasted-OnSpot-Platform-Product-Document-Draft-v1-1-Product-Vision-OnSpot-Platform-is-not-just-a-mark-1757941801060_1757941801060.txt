OnSpot Platform — Product Document (Draft v1)

4. Interface Design (Core Requirement for Engineers)

The interface is the primary touchpoint for B2B and B2C clients. It must be simple, fast, and intuitive, while embedding complexity under the hood.

4.1. Interface Principles
	•	Simplicity First: Minimal clicks to access talent, tasks, and performance data.
	•	Transparency: Real-time performance metrics always visible.
	•	Customization: Configurable dashboards per role (Client, Talent, Manager).
	•	Scalability: Support both B2B enterprise accounts and solo entrepreneurs (B2C).
	•	AI Under the Hood: Do not market as “AI” but integrate it seamlessly (recommendations, automation, insights).

4.2. User Types
	1.	Client (B2B, B2C)
	•	Needs: hire, manage, monitor talent.
	•	Views: Cost savings, performance metrics, project status.
	2.	Talent / Employee
	•	Needs: manage profile, tasks, and payroll.
	•	Views: Time tracking, task board, learning tools.
	3.	Manager / OnSpot Integrator
	•	Needs: oversee multiple accounts, performance systems.
	•	Views: Client dashboards, KPIs, account health, escalations.
