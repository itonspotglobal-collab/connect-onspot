## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Route Configuration
All immersive routes are defined in `client/src/App.tsx` under `AppContent()`:

```typescript
{/* Immersive Routes - Full screen without navigation */}
<Route path="/ai-assistant" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/waitlist" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/pricing" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/enterprise" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/affiliate-marketing" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/bpo-partner" component={ImmersivePage} />

{/* Service Routes - Also immersive */}
<Route path="/services/ai-assistant" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/services/managed" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/services/resourced" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/services/enterprise" component={ImmersivePage} />
<Route path="/services/human-va" component={ImmersivePage} />
```

### ImmersivePage Component
```typescript
// Direct wrapper - no navigation, no layout
function ImmersivePage() {
  return <ComingSoon />;
}
```

### ComingSoon Component
Located at `client/src/components/ComingSoon.tsx`, renders with:
- `fixed inset-0` positioning for full viewport takeover
- OnSpot logo (faintly glowing) at top center
- Neural network animation (optional, can be disabled)
- Gradient text and breathing animations
- Call-to-action buttons
